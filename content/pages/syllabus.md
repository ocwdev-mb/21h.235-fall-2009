Course Description
------------------

> Hitherto it had gone by the original Indian name Manna-hatta, or as some still have it, 'The Manhattoes'; but this was now decried as savage and heathenish... At length, when the council was almost in despair, a burgher, remarkable for the size and squareness of his head, proposed that they should call it New-Amsterdam. The proposition took every body by surprise; it was so striking, so apposite, so ingenious. The name was adopted by acclamation, and New-Amsterdam the metropolis was thenceforth called.
> 
> â€”Washington Irving, 1808

In less tongue-in-cheek style, this course examines the evolution of New York City from 1607 to the present. The readings focus on the city's social and physical histories, and the class discussions compare New York's development to patterns in other cities.

Requirements
------------

Your grade is composed of two essays, two possible quizzes, a final exam, and class participation. Further details about the essays are given under {{% resource_link 55d49313-6f76-a29a-8a7e-0ba88781543c "Assignments" %}}. The specific guidelines will be discussed in class.
